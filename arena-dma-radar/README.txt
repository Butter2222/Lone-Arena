As of 2/22/2025 EFT Arena is still running on Unity 2019. You will need to adjust eft-dma-shared to target this version of Unity (not easy, advanced users only).

When Arena catches up to the regular game with Unity 2022, it should be easy to port this in however.

Also, you will need to recompile the shaders for vis/vischeck chams.
